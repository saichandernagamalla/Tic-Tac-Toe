About Game

Tic-tac-toe is a two player game where each player symbolized by ✔ and ❌ symbols. This game has a 3*3 grid where each player alternatively gives his symbol in unfilled cell of the grid. Player who has first filled 3 cells horizontally or vertically or diagonally will be the winner.

I have implemented this game in two modes
1, Man Vs Man
2, Man Vs Computer
